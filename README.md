# MusGen
MusGen is a code generator for the binary MUS format with validation support.

# Overview
MusGen generates 3 methods for a type description and language:
- Marshal(buf) - encodes data into the MUS format. It will crash if the buffer
  length < Size().
- Unmarshal(buf) - decodes data from the MUS format + performs validation. May 
  return an error if format or data is not valid.
- Size() - returns the size of the data in the MUS format.

The type description consists of fields descriptions, each of which may contain:
- Skip flag
- Validator - name of the function, that validates the field.
- Encoding - of the field.
- MaxLength - positive number. Restricts length of the string, list, array, or
  map field. Those data types are encoded with a length and value.
  There is no need for further decoding if the length of the field is bigger
  than MaxLength, validation error will be returned.
- ElemValidator - name of the function, that validates elements of the list, 
  array or map field.
- ElemEncoding - encoding used for list, array or map elements.
- KeyValidator - name of the function, that validates keys of the map field.
- KeyEncoding - encoding used for map keys.

Also, the type description has:
- Unsafe flag - if it's true, every string and Raw encoded integer will 
  be decoded from the buffer using the faster, unsafe method.
- Suffix - defines a suffix for Marshal/Unmarhsal/Size methods.

# Supported languages
Go

# Backward compatibility
Starting from version 2.0 MusGen generates code incompatible with previous 
versions. Reason: nil pointer support. From now pointers are encoded with an 
additional byte: 0 - for nil pointer, 1 - for not nil pointer.

# MUS format
MUS is an acronym for "Marshal, Unmarshal, Size". The emphasis here is made on 
the presence of the Size function, which has become an important part of the 
Marshal/Unmarshal process.
MUS format tries hard not to add extra bytes to your data. If you feel the need 
for some metadata, you can always add it directly to the type, like in the
[Versioning](#versioning) section.

## Features
- Fields are encoded/decoded by order, so there are no fields' names, only 
  fields' values.
- Integers and floats support two kind of encodings - Varint (default) and Raw.  
- Binary representation of the float (Varint) is turned over before 
  transformation.
- ZigZag encoding is used for signed to unsigned integer mapping.
- Strings, lists, arrays are encoded with length (int type) and values, maps -
  with length and key/value pairs.
- Booleans and bytes are encoded by a single byte.
- Pointers are encoded with nil flag: nil pointer is encoded as 0, not nil 
  pointer as 1 + pointer value.

## Samples
| Type            |     Value           |     MUS Format (hex)                  |     In Parts          |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| int             | 500                 | e807                                  | <sub>e807 - value of the integer</sub> |
| list of strings | {"hello", "world"}  | 040a68656c6c6f0a776f726c64            | <sub>04 - length of the list,<br>0a - length of the first elem,<br>68656c6c6f - value of the first elem,<br>0a - length of the second elem,<br>776f726c64 - value of the second elem.</sub> |
| Person {<br>  Name string<br>  Age int<br>} | {<br>  Name: "Bill",<br>  Age: 35,<br>} | 0842696c6c46 | <sub>08 - length of the Name field,<br>42696c6c - value of the Name field,<br>46 - value of the Age field.</sub> |

## Versioning
MUS format does not have explicit versioning support. But you can always do 
next:
```
// Add version field.
TypeV1 {        
  Version byte
  ...
}

TypeV2 {
  Version byte
  ...
}

// Check version field before Unmarshal.
switch buf[0] {
  case 1:
      _, err = typeV1.Unmarshal(buff)
    ...
  case 2:
    _, err = typeV2.Unmarshal(buff)
    ...  
  default:
    return ErrUnsupportedVersion
}
```

Moreover, it is highly recommended to have a `Version` field. With it, you 
will always be ready for changes in the MUS format.
